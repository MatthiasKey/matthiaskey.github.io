      <p>
        When John recorded the Book of Revelation, the Holy Spirit gave 
it not as chaos but as code — a pattern wrapped in layers of vision and 
time.
        The traditional reader sees seals, trumpets, and vials scattered
 across the pages, but there is a <em>divine chronology</em> buried beneath.
        That structure is what I call the <strong>Cyber Key</strong> — the chronological spine that holds together every prophetic vision.
      </p>

      <h2>Prophecy That Interprets Itself</h2>
      <p>
        Scripture interprets Scripture. That principle must remain the 
foundation of any sound approach to prophecy. When Revelation speaks of 
seals,
        trumpets, and vials, these are not arbitrary metaphors; they are
 literal, sequential judgments, much like the days of creation. God’s 
plan is
        consistent, not abstract. If Genesis means six literal days, 
then Revelation means six literal years of tribulation, culminating in 
His visible reign.
      </p>

      <h2>From the Spiral to the Sequence</h2>
      <p>
        The Apostle John was given a vision that spirals — symbols and 
scenes looping back and forth through heaven and earth.
        My work seeks to unwrap that spiral into a timeline of 
forty-nine sections (K00–K49). Each section aligns events in their 
probable order,
        revealing how the seventh seal contains the seven trumpets, and 
the seventh trumpet holds the seven vials.
        By tracing these in order, the apparent confusion of the 
Apocalypse becomes a coherent chronology of divine justice.
      </p>

      <h2>Literal Where Possible</h2>
      <p>
        Many readers of Revelation drift toward allegory when confronted
 with angels, beasts, and dragons. But to the believer who takes Genesis
 literally,
        it follows that these beings are real. They are not poetic 
abstractions of good and evil — they are God’s creatures, operating 
within His creation
        and subject to His will. A literal reading preserves both God’s 
authority and His promises.
      </p>

      <h2>Hope Beyond Wrath</h2>
      <p>
        For the Body of Christ, the Revelation brings not fear but 
assurance. Those who are in Christ before the tribulation are promised 
deliverance from
        the wrath to come. Yet the book remains a letter of mercy even 
to those who endure it. Through it, the Spirit beckons:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        “Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.” — Revelation 22:17 (KJV)
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The Cyber Key shows judgment unfolding in precision — but grace, too, is threaded through every turn of the spiral.
