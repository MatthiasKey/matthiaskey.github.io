      <h1>About Matthias Key</h1>

      <p>
        Matthias Key is a former laser physicist who, at the age of 29, turned to Jesus Christ as his 
        Lord and Savior. Born in the U.S. to persecuted Christians who had escaped Soviet communism, 
        Matthias excelled academically and began his career in advanced physics before sensing 
        a divine call to ministry.
      </p>

        “Revelation isn’t chaos—it’s code. Once you see its divine sequence, everything becomes clear.”

    <h2>From Physics to Prophecy</h2>
    <p>
      After years of scientific research, Matthias experienced a profound turning point when he encountered the living
      Christ. He redirected his analytical training toward biblical truth, earning a
      <strong>Master of Divinity</strong> from a conservative, Bible-affirming seminary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matthias planted a <strong>Russian-speaking Messianic Jewish congregation in a large American city</strong>, and later trained for ministry
      to upper-caste Hindu immigrants. His mission work reflects both precision and compassion — the heart of a scientist
      and the soul of a servant.

    <h2>Prophetic Focus &amp; Ministry Today</h2>
    <p>
      For more than twenty years, Matthias served in IT and U.S. federal contracting as a <strong>lead cybersecurity
      architect</strong>. In that role, he developed systems thinking and an eye for complex design — perspectives that
      now inform his prophetic teaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, Matthias Key devotes himself fully to the study of Scripture and the communication of prophetic truth.
      Through writing, teaching, and speaking, he helps believers interpret Revelation’s “cyber patterns” and grasp the
      divine order within the end-time message.
